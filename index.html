            <p>Hello! My name is Brandon Niles and I am from Elk River, Minnesota. I have been 
                happily married to my lovely wife for 2 years in October. I am 
                finishing my final semester at BYUI with a Bachelors in Accounting. 
                We enjoy playing pickleball and watching movies together. We currently
                 have 2 cats: Rickey & Millie. We picked up Millie as a stray when she
                  came crying to our doorstep and Millie was from a local shelter. We 
                  have family all over, but plan to move to Salt Lake after graduation
                   near my sisters and nieces. My wife is an elementary education 
                   major and just graduated this past semester.</p>
